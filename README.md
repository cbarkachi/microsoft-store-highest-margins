# Best margins on the Microsoft Store

Scrapes select pages on the Microsoft Store (you choose!) and determines which products have the best resale value when analyzing averaged eBay (sold) price. eBay has an API that returns the suggested selling price of an item but when you make a developer account with them, they make you wait a day before logging in and I'm extremely impatient.

Obviously there are many false negatives, but it's interesting to with enough store pages, you can get a decent number of positive-margin listings.

Added progress bars because scraping/searching can take a while with a bunch of subdomains ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
