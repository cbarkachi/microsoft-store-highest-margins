# Best margins on the Microsoft Store

Scrapes pages on the Microsoft Store and determines which products have the best resale value when analyzing averaged eBay sold price. eBay has an API that returns the suggested selling price of an item but when you make a developer account with them, they make you wait a day before logging in and I'm extremely impatient.

Added progress bars because scraping/searching can take a while with a bunch of subdomains 🤷‍♂️.
